# The Role of a Music Software Engineer: Advancements and Skills

[This article from Yellowbrick](https://www.yellowbrick.co/blog/music/the-role-of-a-music-software-engineer-advancements-and-skills) shares some basic information about the role of a music software engineer. I find it interesting to read about how software engineering can be used in industries that are not usually thought to be that related to tech. Like many others, I have always been intrigued by the idea of working somewhere within the entertainment industry, so this career path would definitely be one I'd like to look into further.

I will say, the article itself does feel partially like a promotion for the NYU Tisch and Billboard course on the music industry, which upon further research, makes sense as Yellowbrick is the host of this online course.

Interesting article! I never thought about this field of music software engineering, but it sounds like a fun field to get into. It reminds me of this artist Lil Data, who live codes music like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNj-I2pZwX8&ab_channel=LilData).
